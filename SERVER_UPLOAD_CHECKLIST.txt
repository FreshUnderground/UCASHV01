UCASH - SERVER UPLOAD CHECKLIST

ERROR: flutter.js returns 500 Internal Server Error

BUILD STATUS (Local):
✓ flutter.js exists locally (9,412 bytes)
✓ Build completed: January 7, 2026
✓ All files ready in: build\web\

UPLOAD REQUIREMENTS:
====================

CRITICAL FILES TO UPLOAD:
-------------------------
[ ] .htaccess              (MUST be uploaded - often hidden!)
[ ] flutter.js             (9 KB - The file causing 500 error)
[ ] flutter_bootstrap.js
[ ] index.html
[ ] main.dart.js
[ ] manifest.json
[ ] favicon.png
[ ] version.json

FOLDERS TO UPLOAD:
-----------------
[ ] assets\        (Complete folder with all subfolders)
[ ] canvaskit\     (Complete folder - Flutter renderer)
[ ] icons\         (All PNG icon files)

FTP UPLOAD SETTINGS:
===================
Server: Your LWS FTP server
Remote Path: /www/ or /public_html/
Transfer Mode: BINARY (not ASCII!)
Show Hidden Files: YES (to see .htaccess)

CRITICAL STEPS:
==============

1. DELETE OLD FILES ON SERVER FIRST
   - Remove all old files from server
   - Ensure clean deployment

2. UPLOAD ALL FILES
   - Use BINARY mode (critical for .js files!)
   - Upload .htaccess (enable "show hidden files")
   - Verify flutter.js uploads completely (9,412 bytes)

3. SET FILE PERMISSIONS (via FTP or cPanel)
   Directories: 755
   Files: 644
   
   Specifically for flutter.js:
   chmod 644 flutter.js

4. VERIFY UPLOAD
   Check file size on server matches local:
   flutter.js should be 9,412 bytes

TEST URLS AFTER UPLOAD:
=======================
These should ALL work without 500 errors:

✓ https://safdal.investee-group.com/
✓ https://safdal.investee-group.com/flutter.js
✓ https://safdal.investee-group.com/flutter_bootstrap.js
✓ https://safdal.investee-group.com/manifest.json
✓ https://safdal.investee-group.com/icons/Icon-192.png

COMMON UPLOAD MISTAKES:
======================
✗ Uploading in ASCII mode instead of BINARY
✗ Not uploading .htaccess (hidden file)
✗ Wrong permissions (file not readable)
✗ Uploading to wrong directory
✗ Incomplete upload (file corrupted)
✗ Server cache (clear browser cache after upload)

IF 500 ERROR PERSISTS:
=====================

1. Check server error logs:
   - Contact LWS support
   - Ask for Apache error.log for flutter.js
   
2. Verify .htaccess uploaded:
   - Check it exists on server
   - Verify MIME type configuration

3. Test with simple file:
   - Create test.js with: console.log('test');
   - Upload and test: https://safdal.investee-group.com/test.js
   - If this also fails, server config issue

4. Disable .htaccess temporarily:
   - Rename .htaccess to .htaccess.backup
   - Test if flutter.js loads
   - If works, issue is in .htaccess rules

5. Contact LWS Support:
   Ask them:
   - "Why does flutter.js return 500 error?"
   - "Is mod_mime enabled for JavaScript files?"
   - "Can you check Apache error logs?"
   - "Are there any restrictions on .js files?"

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Connect to FTP
2. Delete all files in web directory
3. Upload everything from build\web\
4. Set permissions
5. Test URLs above
6. If still 500, contact LWS with this checklist
